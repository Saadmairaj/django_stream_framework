Using Stream Framework you can built a wide variety of functionality.
For instance:

- A Facebook style (aggregated) newsfeed
- A twitter like newsfeed
- A notification system such as Fashiolista's
- A pinterest like activity feed

But in this example we're showing you how to built a feed with activity from people you follow.
